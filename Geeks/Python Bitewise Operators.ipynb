# Python Bitewise Operators are used to perform bitewise calculation on integers. The integers are first converted into binary and then operations are performed on each bit ot corresponding pair of bits, hence the name bitewise operators. The result is then returned into decimal format.
# Bitewise AND Operator
# Python Bitewise AND (&) operator takes two equal-length bit patterns as parameters.The two-bit integers are compared.
#If the bits in the compared positiond of the bit patterns are 1, then the resulting bit is 1. if not, it is 0.


a=10
b=4

#Print bitewise and operations
print('a&b=', a & b)
